# Working with source-git

For the design concept of source-git, please [read here](/source-git/design). These pages are focused on how to work
source-git repositories using the `packit` CLI.

* [Create a source-git repo](work-with-source-git/create-source-git)
* [Updating a spec file](work-with-source-git/update-spec)
* [Pulling fixes from upstream](work-with-source-git/pull-upstream-fixes)
* [Controlling patch generation](work-with-source-git/control-patch-generation)
* [Building current source-git checkout locally](work-with-source-git/build-locally)
* [Proposing your source-git content to dist-git](work-with-source-git/propose-to-dist-git)
* [Sync back changes made in dist-git](work-with-source-git/sync-from-dist-git)
* [Fix diverged history](work-with-source-git/fix-diverged-history)
