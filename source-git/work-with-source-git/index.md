For the design concept of source-git, please [read here](/source-git/design). These pages are focused on how to work
source-git repositories using the `packit` CLI.

* [Updating a spec file](update-spec)
* [Pulling fixes from upstream](pull-upstream-fixes)
* [Controlling patch generation](control-patch-generation)
* [Building current source-git checkout locally](build-locally)
* [Proposing your source-git content to dist-git](propose-to-dist-git)
* [Sync back changes made in dist-git](sync-from-dist-git)
* [Fix diverged history](fix-diverged-history)
