# Update a spec file

Changing a spec file is very straightforward:
1. Edit the file.
2. Commit the change locally.

> Please make sure that your change complies with [Fedora Packaging
> Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/) if
> you intend to bring it to the Fedora ecosystem.

Once that's done, it's a great practice to [create a SRPM and build the spec file change locally]({{< ref "build-locally.md" >}}).

If you are planning to pull an upstream fix, you can [read more here]({{< ref "pull-upstream-fixes" >}}).
