## Week 27 (July 4th – July 10th)

- Packit now correctly reloads upstream specfile after running `pre-sync` action. ([packit#2006](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2006))

## Week 28 (July 11th – July 17th)

- Packit now includes instructions on how to checkout the dist-git PR locally when syncing the release.
  ([packit-service#2116](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2116))
- We have fixed a bug in processing options of `%prep` macros in our `specfile` library. For instance, when a quoted
  string appeared inside an expression expansion, it could lead to improper parsing, rendering the spec file invalid
  after accessing the options. ([specfile#253](https://github.com/packit/specfile/pull/253))
- packit.dev has a new format! As the content has expanded a lot in the recent year, we decided to switch to using
  [Docosaurus](https://docusaurus.io/):
  now all the documentation is in one place and this format also enables additional features for our blog posts.
  ([packit.dev#694](https://github.com/packit/packit.dev/pull/694))

## Weeks 29–30 (July 18th – July 31st)

- With plenty of team members on vacation, we didn't manage to implement any significant new features during these two weeks.
