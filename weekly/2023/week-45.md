## Week 45 (November 7th â€“ November 13th)

- Now Packit allows `~^+` (special characters) in a tag (used for building the version string). ([packit#2154](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2154))
- Downstream Koji builds are now shown in a separate table in `/jobs/downstream-koji-builds` on dashboard and are also accessible via `/api/koji-builds` API endpoint. ([packit-service#2244](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2244), [packit-service#2249](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2249), [dashboard#354](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/354))
