## Week 37 (September 12th â€“ September 18th)

- If you have concerns about Packit uploading new archives to lookaside cache before creating a pull request, you can newly set `upload_sources` to False to disable this. ([packit#2086](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2086))
- We have introduced a new configuration option `notifications.failure_comment.message` that enables notifying users on failure via a comment using the configured message. ([packit-service#2182](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2182))
