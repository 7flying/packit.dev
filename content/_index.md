# Packit

Packit provides tooling and automation to integrate upstream open source
projects into [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org) or [CentOS Stream](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/).
Packit project is composed of two main components:

1. [packit]({{< ref "cli" >}}), a CLI tool, which you can
   [install locally](/docs/guide/#have-packit-tooling-installed-locally)
   and start using right away.

2. [Packit Service]({{< ref "packit-service" >}}), can provide you feedback
   on how is your project integrated with Fedora Linux or CentOS Stream.

Feel free to jump into [the guide]({{< ref "guide" >}}) for using packit.
