# Packit

Packit provides tooling and automation to integrate upstream open source
projects into Fedora operating system. Packit project is composed of two main
components:

1. [packit]({{< ref "cli" >}}), a CLI tool, which you can
   [install locally](/docs/guide/#have-packit-tooling-installed-locally)
   and start using right away.

2. [Packit-as-a-Service]({{< ref "packit-as-a-service" >}}), a
   [GitHub app](https://github.com/marketplace/packit-as-a-service) â€” it can provide you feedback
   on how is your project integrated with Fedora Operating System.

Feel free to jump into [the guide]({{< ref "guide" >}}) for using packit.
