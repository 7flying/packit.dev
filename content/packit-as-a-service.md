Packit-as-a-Service is a GitHub App (https://developer.github.com/apps/about-apps/).

### Easy to use

Using Packit Service is very straightforward: add one config file to your repository,
followed by an RPM spec file and you're good to go. We also support packit as a tool,
so you can always try things locally on your own.

Packit Service validates your pull requests by building your software in Fedora OS.
Once the builds are done, packit lets you know how to install the
RPMs inside your environment so you can try the changes before merging them.
