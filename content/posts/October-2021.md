## Week 39 (September 27th - October 1st)

- Clicking on logo on [dashboard](https://dashboard.packit.dev/) no longer
  opens a new page, but rather reloads the current one.
- We consider [Pipelines view](https://dashboard.packit.dev/pipelines) on
  dashboard to be ready for production use. We're planning to improve the user
  experience when using pipelines with easier navigation and filtering
  options.
- Building the latest development versions of
  [packit](https://github.com/packit/packit) and
  [ogr](https://github.com/packit/ogr) was moved to the
  [packit/packit-dev](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/packit/packit-dev/)
  Copr repo.
