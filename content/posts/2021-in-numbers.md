# 2021 for Packit in numbers

Let's take a look on the last year through some numbers.
We would like to should you some interesting statistics and charts
that can describe the work of Packit during the year 2021.

## Github Application

By now, we have `169` installations of our GitHub application and the `41` is from the last year.
Looking at the monthly numbers bellow, it looks like we are getting back to shape.

## Builds

Comparing to the previous year where we made `28 430` Copr builds for our users,
we made `4.6` times more this year: `133 222` Copr builds.
For those who remember the start of our project,
we had a goal of `5` thousand for the [FLOCK](https://flocktofedora.org/) 2019.
We are now two digits ahead!
And if you are wondering how active is our user on Copr,
we've created `2/3` of all the new Copr project during the year.

To made this happen, we've created `36 133` source RPM files in the last year.

## Test runs

Sadly, we started saving the submit time of the test runs in June
so we have numbers only for the second half of the year.
The numbers are not so high as for the builds but still `18 498` test runs.
