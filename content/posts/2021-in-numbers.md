# 2021 for Packit in numbers

Let's take a look on the year 2021 through some numbers.
We would like to show you some interesting statistics and charts
that can describe the work of Packit during the year 2021.
If you are more interested in new features,
let's take a look on our [second post](../2021-features).

## Github Application

As of now, we have `169` installations of our GitHub application and `41` of them is from the year 2021.
Looking at the monthly numbers below, it looks like we are getting back to shape.

## Builds

Compared to the year 2020 when we made `28 430` Copr builds for our users,
we made `4.6` times more in the year 2021: `133 222` Copr builds.
For those who remember the start of our project,
we had a goal of `5` thousand for the [FLOCK](https://flocktofedora.org/) 2019.
We are now two digits ahead!
And if you are wondering how active is our user on Copr,
we've created `2/3` of all the new Copr projects during the year.

To made this happen, we've created `36 133` source RPM files in the year 2021.

## Test runs

Sadly, we started saving the submit time of the test runs in June
so we have numbers only for the second half of the year.
The numbers are not so high as for the builds but still `18 498` test runs.
