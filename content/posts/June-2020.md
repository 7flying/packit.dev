## Week 23 (June 1st - June 5th)

Hello everyone, during this week we didn't manage to implement any significant new features - most of the work happened under the hood.

### packit

* We have fixed a formatting issue when packit prints installation instructions for using builds from a copr repo (by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#852](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pulls/852)).
* You are able to set up builds when you push to a branch, we have set this up for master branch of packit, feel free to get inspired (by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#851](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pulls/851)).


### packit-as-a-service

* We have run into multiple problems when you set up jobs for PRs and branch pushes - there were multiple fixes for this, packit-service wasn't able to work well with the fact that there are multiple jobs defined for the same job type - e.g. build.


## Week 24 (June 8th - June 11th)

### packit

* [Tomas](https://github.com/TomasTomecek) re-implemented overriding of package config per job. This will enable overriding configuration for builds and releases once the corresponding changes are merged in Packit-as-a-Service. ([#858](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/858), [#859](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/859)).

### packit-as-a-service

* We are now parsing events from Koji about the progress of the builds and report them (by [Franta](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek/), [#657](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/657)).
* We are now able to listen to Gitlab hooks and parse the (comment & push) events (by [Shreyas](https://github.com/shreyaspapi), [#629](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/629), [#671](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/671)).
* Log pages have been restructured by linking SRPM build logs instead of including them (by [Hunor](https://github.com/csomh), [#641](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/641)).
