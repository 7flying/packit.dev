## Week 23 (June 1st - June 5th)

Hello everyone, during this week we didn't manage to implement any significant new features - most of the work happened under the hood.

### packit

* We have fixed a formatting issue when packit prints installation instructions for using builds from a copr repo (by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#852](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pulls/852)).
* You are able to set up builds when you push to a branch, we have set this up for master branch of packit, feel free to get inspired (by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#851](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pulls/851)).


### packit-as-a-service

* We have run into multiple problems when you set up jobs for PRs and branch pushes - there were multiple fixes for this, packit-service wasn't able to work well with the fact that there are multiple jobs defined for the same job type - e.g. build.


## Week 24 (June 8th - June 11th)

### packit

* [Tomas](https://github.com/TomasTomecek) re-implemented overriding of package config per job. This will enable overriding configuration for builds and releases once the corresponding changes are merged in Packit-as-a-Service. ([#858](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/858), [#859](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/859)).

### packit-as-a-service

* We are now parsing events from Koji about the progress of the builds and report them (by [Franta](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek/), [#657](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/657)).
* We are now able to listen to Gitlab hooks and parse the (comment & push) events (by [Shreyas](https://github.com/shreyaspapi), [#629](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/629), [#671](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/671)).
* Log pages have been restructured by linking SRPM build logs instead of including them (by [Hunor](https://github.com/csomh), [#641](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/641)).

## Week 25 (June 15th - June 19th)

### packit

* Packit logs more information for RebaseHelper errors (by [@csomh](https://github.com/csomh), [#865](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/865)).

### packit-as-a-service

 * Obtaining builds via packit [API endpoint](https://prod.packit.dev/api/copr-builds) is now significantly quicker (by [@IceWreck](https://github.com/IceWreck), [#674](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/674)).
 * We now have an API endpoint for obtaining results from testing farm (by [@IceWreck](https://github.com/IceWreck), [#678](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/678)).
 * We finished the implementation of the trigger to create bugs in Bugzilla. Therefore packit is now able to create bugzilla for accepted PR's in CentOS (by [@jpopelka](https://github.com/jpopelka), [#662](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/662)).

## Week 26 (June 22th - June 26th)

### packit

 * packit now supports using custom repositories and packages when building in Copr and has options to preserve the project and to list it in on the Copr home page [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#872](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/872).
 * Custom commands defined by user in packit config now are run in the shell, no more `bash -c` required (by [@TomasTomecek](https://github.com/TomasTomecek), [#871](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/871)).
 * packit now includes pull request ID in version of rpm. (by [@sturivny](https://github.com/sturivny) and [@TomasTomecek](https://github.com/TomasTomecek), [#870](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/870)).

### packit-as-a-service

 * We added support for copr builds in gitlab (by [@shreyaspapi](https://github.com/shreyaspapi), [#683](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/683)).
 * packit-service utilizes the new options introduced in packit (by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#694](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/694)).
