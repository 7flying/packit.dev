## Week 23 (June 1st - June 5th)

Hello everyone, during this week we didn't manage to implement any significant new features - most of the work happened under the hood.

### packit

* We have fixed a formatting issue when packit prints installation instructions for using builds from a copr repo (by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#852](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pulls/852)).
* You are able to set up builds when you push to a branch, we have set this up for master branch of packit, feel free to get inspired (by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#851](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pulls/851)).


### packit-as-a-service

* We have run into multiple problems when you set up jobs for PRs and branch pushes - there were multiple fixes for this, packit-service wasn't able to work well with the fact that there are multiple jobs defined for the same job type - e.g. build.
