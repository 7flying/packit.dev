## Week 18 (May 3rd - May 7th)

- Laura fixed the problem with `fedora-latest` alias
  ([packit#1222](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1222)).

  ([packit-service#1059](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1059),
  [deployment#202](https://github.com/packit/deployment/pull/202)).

- Jirka added support for creating Bugzilla bugs for newly created MRs on GitLab

- The installation instructions for failed or unfinished COPR builds are not
  displayed on the results page ([dashboard#104](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/104)).
