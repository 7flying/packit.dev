## Week 18 (May 3rd - May 7th)

- Laura fixed the problem with `fedora-latest` alias
  ([packit#1222](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1222)).
- We now have separate workers for short and long running tasks. This should
  lead to better responsiveness
  ([packit-service#1059](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1059),
  [deployment#202](https://github.com/packit/deployment/pull/202)).
