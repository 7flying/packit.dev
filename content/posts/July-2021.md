## Week 26+27 (June 28th - July 9th)

Summer is here and vacations with it. Most of the work done in this sprint
is either internal (not user facing) or not finished yet.

- Thanks to Ma≈•ejM Packit Service now triggers a new Copr build if no
  suitable build has been found. That fixes an issue that the service sometimes
  did not react to `/packit test`.
  ([packit-service#1132](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1132))

## Week 28 (July 12th - July 16th)

- We have a new API endpoint for obtaining projects of a given forge.
  ([packit-service#1159](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1159))
- The bug causing that some projects couldn't be loaded in our dashboard was fixed.
  ([packit-service#1161](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1161))

## Week 29 (July 19th - July 23th)

- Various improvements on our dashboard were done; mainly:
  - Projects can be filtered by a forge.
    ([dashboard#124](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/124))
  - Table with jobs was unified and cleaned.
    ([dashboard#121](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/121))
- Newly, we use the [Checks API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks) to show results on GitHub.
  You can still see the results on the bottom of the pull-request page,
  but also in the `Checks` tab.
  This gives us more options like status with a neutral state
  (e.g. currently, for permission errors) or a place for showing more details.
  Don't forget to give our GitHub application permissions to use it.
  You can expect more improvements in this field.
