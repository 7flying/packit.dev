## Week 26+27 (June 28th - July 9th)

Summer is here and vacations with it. Most of the work done in this sprint
is either internal (not user facing) or not finished yet.

- Thanks to Ma≈•ejM Packit Service now triggers a new Copr build if no
  suitable build has been found. That fixes an issue that the service sometimes
  did not react to `/packit test`.
