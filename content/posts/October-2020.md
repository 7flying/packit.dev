## Week 42 (October 12th - October 16th)

Nothing significant happened during this week. The only change was that Hunor
[resolved](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/850) a problem when sentry client library ([the alert service](https://sentry.io/) we use) caused errors in stage
environment and hence the problem didn't make it to production.

We have also released a new version of packit: [0.18](https://github.com/packit/packit/releases/tag/0.18.0).
