## Week 22 (May 31st - June 4th)

- We have a new [status page](https://status.packit.dev), kudos to Jirka!
- Franta fixed a bug that if some action during `propose-downstream` caused an upstream git repository to be dirty,
  the sync for other branches failed. ([packit-service#1111](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1111))
- `packit generate` is not supported anymore. ([packit#1269](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1269))
- Tomáš improved the patch ordering. ([packit#1263](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1263))

## Week 23 (June 7th - June 11th)

- Tomáš improved the way changelog is passed from source-git repo to dist-git.
  ([packit#1265](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1265))
- Hunor created a new subcommand `source-git` to group source-git related commands
  `init` and `update-dist-git`. ([packit#1273](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1273))
- František improved API by adding `submitted_time` to the test result.
  ([packit-service#1113](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1113))

## Week 24 (June 14th - June 19th)

- Franta started working on packit-service being able to submit test jobs to
  internal testing farm so teams can test upstream changes against RHEL.
  ([packit-service#1124](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1124)
  [packit#1280](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1280))
- Hunor continues working on `packit source-git init`: CLI is now more
  streamlined and simplified, and the command produces source-git repos
  matching [our documentation]({{< ref "how-to-source-git.md" >}}).
  ([packit#1277](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1277))
- Maťo Focko finished his refactoring of the `Upstream` class - should not have
  impact on our users, but make the code easier to work with.
  ([packit#1157](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1157))

## Week 25 (June 21st - June 26th)

- Hunor made several improvements to `source-git init`'s CLI.
  ([packit#1284](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1284))
- Thanks to Frantisek there is now one COPR project/repo used for all releases.
  ([packit-service#1128](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1128))
- Laura fixed a bug in syncing downstream to upstream.
  ([packit#1285](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1285))
