## Week 27 (June 29th - July 3rd)

### packit

- We introduced a new command `packit validate-config` which validates the contect of a package configuration file in your project
  (contributed by [@TomasJani](https://github.com/TomasJani), [#826](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/826)).

### packit-as-a-service

- You are now able to override configuration for builds, releases and other jobs (by [@TomasTomecek](https://github.com/TomasTomecek), [#676](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/676)).
  Read more about this feature [here](/docs/configuration/#overriding-global-parameters).

## Week 28 (July 6th - July 10th)

### packit

- Command `validate-config` works properly now and does not produce odd error messages, by [@TomasTomecek](https://github.com/TomasTomecek) and [@csomh](https://github.com/csomh), [#894](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/894) and [#895](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/895)
- You will now properly see git-describe metadata in the `%release` field in spec file when using `srpm` command, by [@TomasTomecek](https://github.com/TomasTomecek), [#894](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/894)
- git-log is being used to get a list of commits between HEAD and latest tag to pick up commit messages and add those to %changelog, by [@TomasTomecek](https://github.com/TomasTomecek), [#889](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/889)
- packit is now able to load metadata from commits of a source-git repo and utilize them when creating patch files, by [@lachmanfrantisek](https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek), [#875](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/875)

### packit-as-a-service

- We now have a new API endpoint: [`/api/projects/`](https://prod.packit.dev/api/projects), by [@IceWreck](https://github.com/IceWreck), [#716](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/716)
- Over the last few weeks, [@lbarcziova](https://github.com/lbarcziova) was very busy with refactoring how jobs and tasks are being executed in packit-service. This work is now complete which allows us to scale the deployment up while giving us better introspection in what's happening inside, by [@lbarcziova](https://github.com/lbarcziova), [#704](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/704)
