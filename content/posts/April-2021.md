## Week 14 (April 4th - April 9st)

- Honza converted packit's test suite from STI to FMF and configured packit to
  synchronize the suite to Fedora dist-git
  ([packit#1192](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1192)).
- Franta fixed a bug in packit which kept only appending targets to an existing
  COPR project which is no longer a case - dropped targets are now being
  removed
  ([packit#1197](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1197)).
