## Week 17 (April 26th - May 2th)

- We have fixed an issue affecting Pipelines view on Dashboard. Currently you should be able to see pipelines again; we are also working on fixing empty rows for `propose-downstream` jobs.
  ([packit-service#1461](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1461))
- Packit now shows the specific info when it does not have permissions to create a Bodhi update of your package.
  When you configure `issue_repository` in your Packit config file, Packit will create an issue in that project and link the dist-git page where you can give _Packit FAS user_ the correct permissions.
  ([packit-service#1465](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1465))
- Packit now exports `PACKIT_PR_ID` environment variable to the Testing Farm.
  ([packit-service#1467](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1467))
- The bug in the Copr permission request is now fixed. (After the release of a new Copr client, Packit didn't catch that permission problem and didn't request the permissions to build in a custom Copr project.)
  ([packit-service#1472](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1472))
- We have fixed a bug that caused Packit to fail when submitting Testing Farm on `commit` trigger.
  ([packit-service#1474](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1472))
- Packit now builds RPMs in Copr triggered by `release` event with correct NVR (without the artificial release suffix). You can use it for distributing RPM packages via Copr.  
  ([packit-service#1478](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1478))
- From the security perspective, we have decided to disable the `create_pr` option for our service, from now on Packit will unconditionally create PRs when running `propose-downstream`.
  We have also updated the `propose-downstream` CLI such that it is possible to use `create_pr` from configuration **or** override it via `--pr/--no-pr` options.
  ([packit#1563](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1563))
- Packit now supports `release_suffix` configuration option that allows you to override the long release string provided by Packit that is used to ensure correct ordering and uniqueness of RPMs built in Copr.
  ([packit#1568](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1568))
