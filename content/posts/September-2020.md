## Week 36 (August 31th - September 4th)

- We store the submission time of SRPM builds now ([packit-service#795](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/795) by [Anchit]).
- [Shreyas] improved implementation of the build status reporting ([packit-service#740](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/740)).
- [Anchit] enhanced the `/koji-builds` endpoint to be more consistent with `/copr-builds` endpoint ([packit-service#791](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/791)).
