## Week 0 ðŸŒ„ (December 20th 2022 â€“ January 2nd 2023)

- ogr now raises `GitForgeInternalError` rather than `PagureAPIException` when
  getting 50x response from the Pagure API. This should increase usability as
  those tasks will be retried.
  ([ogr#762](https://github.com/packit/ogr/pull/762))
- Packit now puts the correct release number into the changelog when the
  Release tag is reset during propose-downstream.
  ([packit#1816](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1816)))
