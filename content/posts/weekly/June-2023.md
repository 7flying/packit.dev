## Week 22 (May 30th – June 5th)

- Packit will now filter the pull requests based on the target branch if the `branch` is specified in the particular job configuration. ([packit-service#2074](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2074))
- Packit now supports `manual_trigger` in the configuration that allows you to make jobs run only when explicitly triggered by a comment. ([packit-service#2069](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2069))

## Week 23 (June 6th – June 12th)

- Our dashboard now shows projects in a table instead of the cards.
  ([dashboard#267](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/267))
- `/packit test` command has two new options:

  With `--identifier` option, Testing Farm will trigger only jobs with that identifier.
  ([packit-service#2079](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2079))

  Also, it is now possible to specify labels for a job and trigger tests based on labels
  using a `--labels` option of the `/packit test` command.
  ([packit#1988](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1988),
  [packit-service#2088](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2088))

- If the `vm_image_build job` doesn't have Copr project/owner configured,
  Copr project used for the latest Copr build of the pull request will be now used.
  ([packit-service#2080](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2080))
- Fixed filters in `files_to_sync` not being applied properly.
  ([packit#1977](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1977))
- The issue that could've caused inconsistencies when tests from a PR
  were supposed to be merged during the test runs on the Testing Farm has been fixed.
  ([packit-service#2090](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2090))
