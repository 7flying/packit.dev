## Week 22 (May 30th â€“ June 5th)

- Packit will now filter the pull requests based on the target branch if the `branch` is specified in the particular job configuration. ([packit-service#2074](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2074))
- Packit now supports `manual_trigger` in the configuration that allows you to make jobs run only when explicitly triggered by a comment. ([packit-service#2069](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2069))
