## Week 23 (June 7th - June 13th)

- The creation of Bodhi updates should not time out anymore, because we no longer get the latest build of a package via Bodhi.
  ([packit#1612](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1612))
- We have fixed a regression where string values for the `targets` and `dist_git_branches` configuration keys were not accepted.

- Git ref name that Packit works with during `propose-downstream` is now made more obvious in logs.
  ([packit#1626](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1626))
- Packit now correctly handles creation of custom archives in root while a specfile is in a subdirectory.
  ([packit#1622](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1622))
- There is a new check for git projects that are allowed to use a custom Copr project.
  There will be a better integration in the form of a new config field in Copr settings that Packit can use.
  In the meantime, the mapping is defined and maintained by the Packit team.
  Let us know if you need a project to be allowed.
  ([packit-service#1556](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1556))
