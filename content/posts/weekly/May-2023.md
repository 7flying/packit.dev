## Week 18 (May 4th - May 9th)

We have experienced issues with automatic Bodhi updates that we are investigating.
In case you miss a Bodhi update, you can
[retrigger the job](https://packit.dev/docs/fedora-releases-guide/#retriggering-2) via `/packit create-update`
comment in a dist-git pull request.
Besides that, during this short week (another Czech Republic public holiday) we didn't manage to implement
any significant new features.

## Week 19 (May 9th â€“ May 15th)

- Packit now doesn't react to its own comments on Pagure and GitLab (on GitHub, this was already implemented).
