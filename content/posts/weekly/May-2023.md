## Week 18 (May 4th - May 9th)

We have experienced issues with automatic Bodhi updates that we are investigating.
In case you miss a Bodhi update, you can
[retrigger the job](https://packit.dev/docs/fedora-releases-guide/#retriggering-2) via `/packit create-update`
comment in a dist-git pull request.
Besides that, during this short week (another Czech Republic public holiday) we didn't manage to implement
any significant new features.

## Week 19 (May 9th – May 15th)

- Packit now doesn't react to its own comments on Pagure and GitLab (on GitHub, this was already implemented).
  ([packit-service#2048](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2048))

## Week 20 (May 16th – May 22nd)

- We have implemented a denylisting mechanism allowing us to denylist namespaces/projects to prevent misuse of our service. ([packit-service#2046](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2046))
- Packit will now additionally require for each test job requiring build a build job definition to be present in the Packit configuration file. ([packit-service#2012](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2012))
- Packit now checks whether the configured architecture for the test target is supported by Testing Farm and in case not doesn't submit these test requests. ([packit-service#2053](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2053))
