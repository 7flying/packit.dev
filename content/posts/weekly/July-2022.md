## Weeks 26–27 (June 27th–July 11th)

- We adjusted the way we check the author of the PR for PRs related to
  dist-git commits that trigger Koji build jobs. This should fix the race
  condition causing not creating Koji builds in some cases.
  ([packit-service#1573](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1573))
- Results from Testing Farm are now correctly reported when multiple jobs with
  different identifier are defined.
  ([packit-service#1565](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1565))
- On a Bodhi authentication error, Packit will retry the task multiple times
  in ten-minute intervals to be able to fix the issue in the meantime.
  ([packit-service#1564](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1564))

## Week 28 (July 12th–July 18th)

- Packit now guides everyone better when a FAS account is private
  and updates the internal information about installations correctly
  when the app is reinstalled.
  ([packit-service#1575](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1575))
- Packit can now correctly create Bodhi updates using the new Bodhi 6 client.
  ([packit#1651](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1651))
- RPM build commands of Packit CLI have been merged into one build subcommand,
  for more information see the updated [documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/cli/build/).
  We have also introduced a new --srpm option to the new build subcommand
  that can be used to trigger local, Copr or Koji build from an already built
  SRPM rather than the one implicitly created by Packit.
  ([packit#1611](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1611))
