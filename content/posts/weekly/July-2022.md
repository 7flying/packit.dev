## Weeks 26–27 (June 27th–July 11th)

- We adjusted the way we check the author of the PR for PRs related to
  dist-git commits that trigger Koji build jobs. This should fix the race
  condition causing not creating Koji builds in some cases.
  ([packit-service#1573](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1573))
- Results from Testing Farm are now correctly reported when multiple jobs with
  different identifier are defined.
  ([packit-service#1565](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1565))
- On a Bodhi authentication error, Packit will retry the task multiple times
  in ten-minute intervals to be able to fix the issue in the meantime.
  ([packit-service#1564](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1564))
