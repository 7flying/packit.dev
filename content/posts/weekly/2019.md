# Initial version 0.1.0 of packit is out! (2019-03-08)

We would like to announce general availability of the initial version of
packit, titled '0.1.0'.

Since this is our first release, we would like to ask you to be patient if you
encounter any issues. We work hard on packit's usability. If you feel like that
packit is doing something weird or if anything is unclear, don't hesitate and
reach out to us by creating [a new GitHub
issue](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues/new).

The initial release contains two commands:

- `packit propose-update` — Opens a pull request in dist-git for the latest
  upstream release of a selected repository.
- `packit watch-releases` — Watches events for all the upstream releases and
  performs `propose-update` for those who use packit.

## Installation

```
$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit
```

Or

```
$ pip3 install --user packitos
```

Or (if you're brave)

```
$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit
```

## Requirements

Present features have strict requirements on the upstream projects:

- You need to have a packit config file present in the upstream repo.

- You need to have spec file present in the upstream repo.

This workflow is suitable for people who are both upstream and downstream
maintainers of the particular project. If you don't fit into that bucket, then
packit might not be ready for you, yet. Please wait till we land more
[source-git](/source-git/)
related functionality into packit.

## `propose-update`

I'm going to demonstrate this functionality on
[ogr](https://github.com/packit-service/ogr.git), our library for git forges,
which powers packit.

It was recently approved for Fedora, so we can use packit to bring the initial
version of ogr into Fedora Rawhide, 30 and 29.

### Do we have everything?

Let's see [guide](/docs/cli/propose-update/) for
the `propose-update` command on what we need:

#### 0. The upstream repository with a valid upstream release.

```
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:TomasTomecek/ogr.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:TomasTomecek/ogr.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/packit-service/ogr.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/packit-service/ogr.git (push)
```

Yup.

```
$ git tag --list
0.0.1
0.0.2
0.0.3

$ git checkout 0.0.3
Note: checking out '0.0.3'.
```

And the tag name is matching the version in a spec file:

```
$ grep Version python-ogr.spec
Version:        0.0.3
```

#### 1. Packit config file placed in the upstream repository.

```
$ ll .packit.yaml
-rw-rw-r--. 1 tt tt 177 Mar  1 17:44 .packit.yaml
```

Check.

#### 2. Spec file present in the upstream repository.

```
$ ll python-ogr.spec
-rw-rw-r--. 1 tt tt 1.3K Mar  1 17:43 python-ogr.spec
```

:+1:

#### 3. Pagure API tokens for Fedora Dist-git.

```
$ env | grep TOKEN
PAGURE_USER_TOKEN=will
PAGURE_FORK_TOKEN=not
GITHUB_TOKEN=share, sorry
```

#### 4. Valid Fedora Kerberos ticket.

```
$ kinit ttomecek@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG
Password for ttomecek@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG:

$ klist
Ticket cache: KEYRING:persistent:1024:krb_ccache_g0t1Ty3Ah
Default principal: ttomecek@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
03/01/2019 18:12:25  03/02/2019 18:12:19  krbtgt/FEDORAPROJECT.ORG@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG
        renew until 03/08/2019 18:12:19
```

We're all set!

### Time to shine

We are still in the "ogr" upstream git repository.

```
$ packit propose-update

uploading to the lookaside cache
PR created: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr/pull-request/1
```

Mind-blowing, isn't it? Now we have latest python-ogr in Fedora Rawhide by
running only a single command.

I have also [added](https://release-monitoring.org/project/18832/) ogr into release-monitoring as packit suggests.

Once we are okay with the changes, we have to [merge the pull
request](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr/pull-request/1). That's
our responsibility, as maintainers.

### Building in koji

That was rough, can't wait to do this with packit.

Let's do Fedora 30 now:

```

```

And so on...

## Conclusion

As you can see, packit is useful for us right away.

We'll be delighted if you try it out and let us know what you think.

# Packit 0.2.0 is here! (2019-03-19)

Our sprint nears an end which means we have released [a new version of packit -
0.2.0](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/releases/tag/0.2.0)! You can
expect a new release after every sprint (i.e. every 2 weeks).

The 0.2.0 version has a bunch of new features and improvements: you can find
a complete list [in the
changelog](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#020).
We also have a [detailed
documentation](https://github.com/packit-service/packit#workflows-covered-by-packit)
for all the workflows packit covers.

Let's get through what's new:

1. We have decided to rename two keys in our config file so they are more
   descriptive. Old names still work but they are deprecated:
   - `package_name` → `downstream_package_name`
   - `upstream_name` → `upstream_project_name`
2. You don't need to touch dist-git at all when getting your new upstream
   release into Fedora, you can stay in your upstream repository and just fire
   off a bunch of packit calls:
   - `packit propose-update` to create a pull request in Fedora dist-git with
     the selected upstream release
   - `packit build` to build the new upstream release once the pull request is
     merged
   - and finally, `packit create-update` creates a new bodhi update (if you
     chose a stable Fedora release)
3. Packit now has a `srpm` command which creates an SRPM out of the local
   content of your upstream repository.
4. You can now use packit to sync files from your dist-git repo back into
   upstream (mainly to keep spec files in sync). `sync-from-downstream` is the
   command.
5. Command `propose-update` received numerous improvements:
   - You can pick upstream version to use.
   - Packit will NOT check out the git ref with the upstream release if you
     specify `--local-content`
   - It's possible to force packit to execute `fedpkg new-sources` using
     `--force-new-sources` and bypass the caching mechanism.

## Installation

Please make sure you are installing `0.2.0`:

```
$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit
```

Or

```
$ pip3 install --user packitos
```

You can also install packit from master branch, if you are brave enough:

```
$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit
```

## How are we using packit?

I'd like to show you how we used packit to bring a new upstream
release of ogr into Fedora, a library which packit is using.

Once we have performed an upstream release of ogr, we can propose an update in
dist-git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/packit-service/ogr && cd ogr/

$ packit propose-update
INFO: Running 'anitya' versioneer
Version in upstream registries is '0.0.3'.
Version in spec file is '0.0.3'.

  stdout: 'On branch 0.0.3-master-update
nothing to commit, working tree clean'
```

Whoops, it seems that I have messed up, I forgot to bump the spec file in the
upstream repo when doing the release. I will bump it locally and utilize
`--local-content` argument:

```
$ rpmdev-bumpspec -n 0.1.0 -c 'New upstream release: 0.1.0' *.spec

$ packit propose-update --local-content
INFO: Running 'anitya' versioneer

```

Once the scratch build is done and tests passed we merged and built it:

```
$ packit build
Using 'master' dist-git branch
Cloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr.git -> /tmp/tmprp3cmdjy

Created task: 33616980
Task info: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=33616980
```

We have done the same for F30 and F29.

The previous commands were run in the directory of the upstream repository. Packit also accepts path to your upstream clone, or even URL. So let's create a bodhi update for python-ogr by specifying the upstream repo URL:

```
$ cd $HOME

$ packit create-update --dist-git-branch f29 https://github.com/packit-service/ogr
Cloning repo: https://github.com/packit-service/ogr -> /tmp/tmpdkdadmn_
Koji builds for package python-ogr and koji tag f29-updates-candidate:
 - python-ogr-0.1.0-1.fc29
Cloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr.git -> /tmp/tmpn1809ec9
Bodhi update FEDORA-2019-78948e62d2:
- https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-78948e62d2
- stable_karma: 3
- unstable_karma: -3
- notes:
New upstream release: 0.1.0
```

And that's it, no need to access dist-git any more.

Please give packit a try and let us know what you think.

# Packit 0.3.0 (2019-04-11)

In the [previous post](/posts/packit-020/) we promised to
provide a new release every 2 weeks and we are already breaking this promise as
it's been 3 weeks since then. We decided to wait with the release to merge
several pull requests related to source-git support.

Now the good news. You can find a complete list of new features and
improvements of version
[0.3.0](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/releases/tag/0.3.0) in the
[changelog](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#030).

## Features

- You can now specify your own hooks or actions to replace default packit
  behaviour. (More information can be found [in the
  documentation](/docs/actions/)).
- Packit supports pagure.io-based upstream projects.
- Commands `propose-update` and `sync-from-downstream` supports [copying
  directories](/docs/configuration/#minimal-sample-config).
- A new command `status`! It displays useful upstream/downstream info.
- Packit now supports [Source-git](/source-git/). The
  functionality is not available, yet - we will add a CLI interface for it in
  the next release.
- You can now have a config file for packit in your home directory(`~/.config/packit.yaml`).
- Packit installed from an RPM now has manpages.

### `packit status` example

```bash
$ packit status
Cloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/packit.git -> /tmp/tmp84we_6n8
Downstream PRs: No open PRs.
f29: 0.2.0
f30: 0.2.0
master: 0.2.0
```

# Packit 0.4.0 & 0.4.1 (2019-05-18)

It's been over a month since we released packit "0.3.0". Here comes packit 0.4.0 (and patch release 0.4.1) and as always they bring a lot of new features and improvements.

You can find a complete list in the
[changelog](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#040).

## Packit as a service

- We have Packit as a service running in OpenShift and also a GitHub App, which uses it.
  Unfortunately it's still not in the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace),
  so [we](https://github.com/packit-service) have been the only one using it so far.
  The service/app submits builds in [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/packit/) and
  once they're done it adds a GitHub status and comment with instructions how to install the builds.
  The service is now configurable via [jobs](/docs/configuration/#packit-service-jobs) defined
  in configuration file.
- Packit is now able to check GPG signatures of the upstream commits against configured fingerprints.

## CLI

- `srpm` command now works also with [Source-git](/source-git/).
- `status` command now access remote APIs asynchronously in parallel, which should speed up
  the execution.
- CLI has new `--dry-run` option to not perform any remote changes (pull requests or comments).
- Fedmsg parsing has been unified into a single `listen-to-fedmsg` command.

# Packit 0.4.2 (2019-06-26)

Another relase after a month since [0.4.1](https://packit.dev/posts/packit-041/), this time mostly with bug fixes.

We've been busy polishing our [GitHub App](https://packit.dev/packit-as-a-service/) recently, therefore we had no resources for new features.

See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#042) for more details.

# September 2020

## Week 36 (August 31th - September 4th)

- We store the submission time of SRPM builds now ([packit-service#795](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/795) by [Anchit]).
- [Shreyas] improved implementation of the build status reporting ([packit-service#740](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/740)).
- [Anchit] enhanced the `/koji-builds` endpoint to be more consistent with `/copr-builds` endpoint ([packit-service#791](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/791)).

[anchit]: https://github.com/IceWreck
[shreyas]: https://github.com/shreyaspapi

## Week 37 (September 7th - September 11th)

- Stage now uses [Tokman](https://github.com/packit/tokman) to get access tokens for GitHub, which should resolve race condition when running parallel jobs
  (Tokman by [Hunor], ogr integration by [Matej]).
- [Franta] has addressed problems with Testing-Farm cluster with custom response on PRs that links to more information ([pinned info](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/803), [packit-service#798](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/798)).

[hunor]: https://github.com/csomh
[matej]: https://github.com/mfocko
[franta]: https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek

## Week 38 (September 14th - September 18th)

- The combination of the source-git patches with existing patches now works well
  ([packit#963](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/963)).
- Service now mostly supports also GitLab as you can see
  [here](https://gitlab.com/packit-service/hello-world/-/merge_requests/10)
  or [here](https://gitlab.com/packit-service/src/drpm/-/merge_requests/2).
  A lot of small issues were fixed in the last week
  ([packit-service#806](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/806),
  [packit-service#812](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/812),
  [packit-service#814](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/814),
  [packit-service#815](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/815),
  [packit-service#816](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/816)
  ).
- Created Copr projects are now prefixed with the hostname
  for non-GitHub services and also support multipart namespaces
  ([packit-service#819](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/819)).
- [Laura] fixed two testing-farm related issues
  ([packit-service#808](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/808),
  [packit-service#809](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/809)).
  You can now use `test` job also on Pagure and GitLab thanks to that.

[laura]: https://github.com/lbarcziova

## Week 39 (September 21st - September 25th)

- Packit-service can be configured to work with private namespaces. This is plumbing work which we need right now for CentOS Stream. We are not planning to enable this for GitHub - packit-service will still work only for public repositories, private ones are ignored. [packit-service#831](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/831)
- If git tag contains more information than just version (e.g. `pkg_name-v1.2.3`), it is possible to use upstream_tag_template to extract version from the tag, which will be used in a subsequent task. [doc](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#upstream_tag_template) [packit#959](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/959)
- Added support for globbing pattern in upstream_ref. [doc](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#upstream_ref) [packit#960](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/960)
- Packit `--remote` is global option now and available for all commands. Because of this `sync-from-downstream --remote` was renamed to `--remote-to-push`. Remote can now be specified in the user's config (via upstream_git_remote parameter). [packit#977](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/977)

Following bugs were fixed:

- Packit dropping leading zeros in version. [packit#814](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/814)
- Packit CLI issue caused by picking incorrect copr project name. [packit#971](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/971)

## Week 40 (September 28th - October 2nd)

- Packit-service is now explicitly checking if requested copr-build targets exist and if not, the user is informed about it. [packit-service#835](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/835)
- We have improved the way how packit updates `%setup` line in a spec file - you are now able to set content of `-n` option via archive_root_dir_template config option, it defaults to `{upstream-pkg-name}`. [doc](https://github.com/packit/packit.dev/pull/167) [packit#834](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/834)
- Packit is able to generate a patch file with format-patch without leading a/ and b/ in the patch diff. Required for patches in dist-git which are applied with -p0.
- Contribution guidelines were updated, now we have one shared [link](https://github.com/packit/contributing).

# Week 44-48 (November) 2019

With this blog post we'd like to continue with the idea of openly communicating changes in Packit.
Since most of the developers use Packit as the [GitHub App](https://packit.dev/packit-as-a-service) (which uses code from [this repository - Packit Service](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service)), this blog will be about changes in all the parts, i.e. the GitHub App, the Packit Service and Packit itself.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

At the moment the workflow is that one of us manually triggers production container image build at the end of a week.
This image is then automatically deployed into our production instance of the service over a weekend (Sun/Mon night) so that everyone can start a week with all the amazing stuff we added the previous week.
In case an issue makes it through our staging instance into production uncaught, we can easily rollback on Monday.
The same person also writes down what's changed in Packit (service/app) since previous deployment.

## Changes in production (since the end of November)

[Previous post](/posts/packit-042/) is almost half a year old so we won't list all the changes since then, but only since last deployment, i.e. since end of December.

### Packit

Previous deployment was running [packit-0.7.1](https://pypi.org/project/packitos/0.7.1/).
We haven't released a newer version since then, but in the service we install Packit from the Git repository (we have a separate `stable` git branch for our production deployment).
From the most visible changes, Packit now:

- better handles Create-archive action
- is able to work in a repo with detached head
- logs output from subprocesses in realtime
- syncs config file and spec file by default in Propose-update action
- hadles patches with undecodable chars

### Packit Service

Now:

- better reports Copr builds
  - uses separate commit status for srpm build and every chroot
  - clears test farm commit statuses when new build is triggered
  - better handles failed Copr builds
- gracefully handles no config file in the repo
- better handles when no (copr build) targets are specified in config file
- better checks whitelist of users
