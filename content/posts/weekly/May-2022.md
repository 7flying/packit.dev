## Week 17 (April 26th - May 2th)

- We have fixed an issue affecting Pipelines view on Dashboard. Currently you should be able to see pipelines again; we are also working on fixing empty rows for `propose-downstream` jobs.
  ([packit-service#1461](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1461))
- Packit now shows the specific info when it does not have permissions to create a Bodhi update of your package.
  When you configure `issue_repository` in your Packit config file, Packit will create an issue in that project and link the dist-git page where you can give _Packit FAS user_ the correct permissions.
  ([packit-service#1465](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1465))
- Packit now exports `PACKIT_PR_ID` environment variable to the Testing Farm.
  ([packit-service#1467](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1467))
- The bug in the Copr permission request is now fixed. (After the release of a new Copr client, Packit didn't catch that permission problem and didn't request the permissions to build in a custom Copr project.)
  ([packit-service#1472](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1472))
- We have fixed a bug that caused Packit to fail when submitting Testing Farm on `commit` trigger.
  ([packit-service#1474](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1472))
- Packit now builds RPMs in Copr triggered by `release` event with correct NVR (without the artificial release suffix). You can use it for distributing RPM packages via Copr.  
  ([packit-service#1478](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1478))
- From the security perspective, we have decided to disable the `create_pr` option for our service, from now on Packit will unconditionally create PRs when running `propose-downstream`.
  We have also updated the `propose-downstream` CLI such that it is possible to use `create_pr` from configuration **or** override it via `--pr/--no-pr` options.
  ([packit#1563](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1563))
- Packit now supports `release_suffix` configuration option that allows you to override the long release string provided by Packit that is used to ensure correct ordering and uniqueness of RPMs built in Copr.
  ([packit#1568](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1568))

## Week 18 (May 3rd - May 9th)

- `packit source-git` commands learnt to replace [Git-trailers in commit messages](https://packit.dev/source-git/work-with-source-git/control-patch-generation/) if they already exist. ([packit#1577](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1577))
- When initializing source-git repos, the author of downstream commits created from patch files which are not in a git-am format is set to the original author of the patch-file in dist-git, instead of using the locally configured Git author. ([packit#1575](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1575))
- Packit now correctly inform users about downstream errors only on the last try. (Previously, Packit informed for all tries even the last try succeded.) ([packit-service#1485](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1485))
- Dashboard now also shows propose-downstream jobs in pipelines view. We have also merged all jobs to one column to minimize dead space on the page. ([dashboard#178](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/178))

## Week 19 (May 10th - May 16th)

- Metadata dictionary is no longer required when specifying a job. Keys which used to belong to the yaml metadata dictionary are now keys of the job dictionary itself. ([packit#1569](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1569))
- Packit now correctly removes patches during `packit source-git init` when the preamble does not contain blank lines. ([packit#1582](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1582))
- Packit now supports `--release-suffix` parameter in all of the related CLI commands. Also we have added a support for the `release_suffix` option from configuration to the CLI. With regards to that we have introduced a new CLI switch `--default-release-suffix` that allows you to override the configuration option to Packit-generated default option that ensures correct NVR ordering of the RPMs. ([packit#1586](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1586))
- Resolved an SRPM build problem caused by a new version of git that refuses to fetch in a git repo when it's owned on the OS level by someone else. ([packit#1497](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1497))
- Packit now passes `PACKIT_COPR_PROJECT` and `PACKIT_COPR_RPMS` variables to the Testing Farm. `PACKIT_COPR_PROJECT` holds Copr project in format owner/project and `PACKIT_COPR_RPMS` space-separated RPMs that were built in Copr. ([packit-service#1486](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1486))
- Packit now builds only its own dist-git commits. Other commits are not being acted upon. For reasoning, see [packit-service#1490](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/1490). ([packit-service#1498](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1498))
- We have automated our allowlisting process via a new Packit comment command `/packit verify-fas`. You can find more info in [our requirements](https://packit.dev/docs/packit-service/#requirements-for-running-packit-service-jobs). ([packit-service#1487](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1487))

## Week 20 (May 17th - May 23rd)

- We have fixed an issue with the handling of finished or failed builds from Copr on release builds, which has resulted in not setting the correct statuses on commits. ([packit-service#1513](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1513))
- When doing an automatic FAS account verification, Packit now suggests the URL where the GitHub account needs to be set. ([packit-service#1508](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1508))
