## Week 45 (November 2nd - November 6th)

- [Laura] implemented an option for packit to copy description from a release into
  a changelog when running `propose-update`. Also the default message has been changed
  to the list of commit messages from last release. ([packit#1004](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1004))
- [Jano] improved handling of build targets in packit. ([packit#986](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/986))
- [Tomas] improved an experience of a contributor to source-git in case the contributor
  doesn't follow git-am patches style that is used. ([packit#1000](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1000))

## Week 46 (November 9th - November 13th)

- [Tomas] improved the UX of logging in the CLI. ([packit#1014](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1014))
- [Jano] improved logic of acquiring current version in the CLI. ([packit#1013](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1013))
- We appreciate getting feedback from our users, if you could find some time to
  do so, there is an [open issue](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/859)
  for it.
